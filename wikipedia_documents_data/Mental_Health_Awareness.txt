Mental (typographically stylized MƎNTAL:) is a mystery medical drama television series produced by Fox's subsidiary Fox Telecolombia, which aired from May 26 to August 14, 2009 on FOX international channels for Latin America, Europe and Asia, starring Chris Vance and Annabella Sciorra. Mental was executive-produced by Deborah Joy LeVine – creator of the successful drama series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman and the Lifetime series The Division, and executive producer of Any Day Now, Dawson's Creek and the CBS series Early Edition – and her brother and writing/producing partner, Dan LeVine.  Following its U.S. debut, it aired in 35 additional countries. Fox Latin America aired the first episode as a "Worldwide Premiere" on June 2, 2009. Fox aired the pilot episode on May 26, 2009, for the American market. Fox TV Studios ordered 13 episodes. It began production on June 2, 2008, at the Fox Telecolombia production facilities in Bogotá.
Although the series was filmed in the city of Bogotá in Colombia representing Los Angeles (United States), no Colombian actor was cast as a regular character and very few were cast for occasional roles, because of the strict American nature of the series. According to TVWeek, Jacqueline McKenzie, Derek Webster, Nicholas Gonzalez, and Marisa Ramirez were added to the cast of Mental, "probably as recurrent characters."
Due to declining ratings, Fox cancelled the show following its first season.


== Characters ==


=== Main ===
Dr. Jack Gallagher (Chris Vance)
The protagonist of the show, Jack is an Australian man living in America, for what seems like much of his life as his stepfather of many years is American. He uses rather unorthodox methods to get inside the patient's head to help cure them; however, this usually gains him spite from his fellow doctors. He enjoys riding his bike and has a mentally unstable sister whom he is trying to find, and has been for four years. At the end of the episode "Do Over," he finds Becky, and she is placed in the hospital, diagnosed with schizophrenia. Jack's mother and stepfather come and try to convince him to let them take Becky to Florida for treatment. Jack is skeptical, but Becky decides to leave with her parents. In the season finale, Jack is seen talking to an anonymous therapist (who turns out to be himself), and he admits that he has an irrational fear of developing schizophrenia, which is why he is afraid of commitment. It is also revealed that he, most likely, is dealing with clinical depression at this point. In the final scene, he punches Carl and is subsequently fired. Jack then leaves; the season, as well as the series, ends.  The last shot of the series shows us Dr. Gallagher now vagrant and without direction, in opposition to his recently vagrant sister, who has chosen to return home with her family.  The season ends in direct opposition to the season opening.
Nora Skoff (Annabella Sciorra)
She is a hospital administrator who shares a romantic past with Dr. Gallagher. Nora has a distinctive and conservative style. She successfully battled cancer and is divorced with two daughters.
Dr. Carl Belle (Derek Webster)
Dr. Belle is a master politician who is dedicated to Jack's downfall, even secretly black-mailing Arturo to spy on Jack.
Dr. Veronica Hayden-Jones (Jacqueline McKenzie)
Dr. Hayden-Jones is a dedicated psychiatrist who is upset that she wasn't given Jack's job. She is married to a musician, but was cheating on him with one of the doctors in the hospital.  This doctor has subsequently resigned.
Dr. Chloë Artis (Marisa Ramirez)
Dr. Artis is a gorgeous doctor who is passing the time in a residency she feels is beneath her until Jack opens her mind to the inspirational benefits of psychiatry. She is frequently pursued by Arturo before she reveals to him that she is a lesbian.
Dr. Arturo Suarez (Nicholas Gonzalez)
Dr. Suarez is a first-year resident. He is young and cocky, constantly looking for love (or sex), and won't seem to give up on Chloe, even knowing her sexual orientation.
